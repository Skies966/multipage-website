      <p> The Earth's temperature has been rising slowly due to pollution and rising carbon dioxide emissions. Since the 19th century, the earth's temperature has risen 1 degree celsius, or 2 degrees fahrenheit. According to NASA, most of this warming has occurred in the last 40 years, with the last 7 years being the warmest (<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">NASA Climate</a>).

      <h2>What is Causing Global Warming?</h2>
      <p>
Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide(CO2) collects in the atmosphere and absorbs sunlight and solar radiation. These pollutions trap the heat in the atmosphere, causing the world to get hotter. These heat trapping pollutants are called greenhouse gasses.(<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101">NRDC Global Warming</a>) The increase of burning fossil fuels, and the clearing of forests and huge fields for housing and industry plants in the twenty-first century is a huge contributor to the world's temperature rising at a faster pace than ever seen before.
