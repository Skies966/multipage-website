<h1>Global Warmings Effect on Animals</h1>
<p>Global warming has a huge effect on the animals around the world too. In places like the arctic, the ice is melting leaving tons of animals with nowhere to go.
     The forests around the world are also seeing an increase in fires, killing thousands of animals and destroying their homes.
      Sea levels are rising, ruining our beaches and birthing places for animals such as sea turtles.

      <p>Animals are also becoming out of sync with the world heating up. Lots of animals are starting to come out of hibernation early, before their food supply has come back. (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-bears-come-out-of-hibernation-month-early/">CBS News Climate Change</a>) As well, birds are migrating earlier than they should and because of this, could be stuck in the colder climate that is Canada. 
      Birds are also laying their eggs earlier in the year, and have no food to feed their babies as their food has not come out for the season yet.
